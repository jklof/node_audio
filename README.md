# node_audio
Node based realtime audio processing

## setup

Create the complete development environment with a single command
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the new environment
```bash
conda activate node-audio-dev
```
## compile and install
This command does two magic things:
 - Triggers scikit-build-core, which runs CMake to compile C++ code.
 - Installs Python package in a way that any changes to the .py
    files are immediately reflected without needing to reinstall.

```bash
pip install -e . -v
```

## run
```bash
python main.py
```

## remove the environment
```bash
conda deactivate node-audio-dev
conda env remove --name node-audio-dev
```
